FishStock README

Overview

Welcome to FishStock, a chess engine with a graphical user interface (GUI) built in C++ by a 13-year-old chess enthusiast and programmer! This project is under active development, aiming to create a fun and functional chess engine that players of all levels can enjoy. FishStock combines solid chess mechanics with an intuitive and easy-to-use GUI.

Features
	•	Graphical User Interface (GUI): FishStock includes a clean and interactive interface for visualizing the board and making moves.
	•	Legal Move Generation: Generates and enforces legal moves for all pieces.
	•	Interactive Gameplay: Play as White or Black against the engine or another player locally.
	•	Turn-Based Play: Automatically alternates turns between players.
	•	Basic AI: The engine can play basic moves as an opponent (improving over time).

Planned Features
	•	Advanced AI: Improve the AI’s decision-making with evaluation functions and search algorithms.
	•	Full Rule Support: Add support for special moves like castling, en passant, and promotions.
	•	Customizable Settings: Add options for time controls, board themes, and difficulty levels.
	•	Undo/Redo Moves: Allow users to correct mistakes or review their game.
	•	Save/Load Games: Save game progress and resume at any time.
	•	Online Multiplayer: Enable players to challenge friends over the internet.

How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FishStock.git


	2.	Compile the code with a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) and any necessary libraries for the GUI:

g++ -o FishStock fishstock.cpp -l<gui-library>

(Replace <gui-library> with the actual library, such as SDL, SFML, or Qt, depending on the implementation.)

	3.	Run the program:

./FishStock


	4.	Enjoy the game using the interactive GUI!
